                <ul class="no-tracking-list">

                        <li><strong>Your App Icon:</strong> The app icon you pick stays on your phone.</li>

                <h2>About The Ads</h2>
                <p>We show ads to keep the app free. Google helps us show these ads.</p>
                
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>What Google Might See</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What kind of phone you have</li>
                        <li>Roughly what city you're in (not your exact address)</li>
                        <li>If you tap on ads</li>
                        <li>If the app crashes</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p><strong>Why:</strong> To show ads, see if they work, and stop bad people from cheating.</p>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> The ads are the same for everyone - they're not special just for you.</p>

                    <li>It's totally optional - the app works great without tips!</li>
