                <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
                <p class="lead">We don’t collect personal information directly from you. However, because the app now includes Google AdMob ads, Google and its advertising partners may collect certain device and usage data to display ads, prevent spam, detect abuse, and help ensure fair play.</p>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Information That Stays on Your Device</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Your Game Scores:</strong> All your reaction times are saved only on your device. We never see them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your Settings:</strong> Things like your chosen theme, sound preferences, and vibration settings are stored only on your device.</li>
                        <li><strong>App Icon Choice:</strong> Your selected app icon is remembered on your device only.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Apple Game Center (Optional)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you choose to use Game Center, Apple handles your leaderboard scores according to their privacy policy.</li>
                        <li>You can play the game without Game Center — it’s completely optional.</li>
                        <li>Game Center lets you compete with other players, but we don't see your personal information.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Guest Mode</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you enable Guest Mode, the app temporarily stores scores that disappear when you turn off Guest Mode.</li>
                        <li>This lets someone else use your device without affecting your personal scores.</li>
                    </ul>

            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Advertising &amp; Third-Party Tracking</h2>
                <p>This app uses Google AdMob to display full-screen interstitial ads.</p>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>What AdMob may collect</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Device identifiers (such as Apple’s IDFA)</li>
                        <li>Coarse location (estimated from your IP address)</li>
                        <li>App interaction data (such as ad views and taps)</li>
                        <li>Performance and crash data</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>How this information may be used</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Serving and personalizing ads</li>
                        <li>Measuring ad performance</li>
                        <li>Preventing spam and fraudulent activity</li>
                        <li>Ensuring fair play within the app and ad ecosystem</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Data collected by AdMob is subject to Google’s Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
                <p>You can control whether tracking occurs by adjusting your iOS App Tracking Transparency and Limit Ad Tracking settings. If you decline tracking, ads may still appear but will be less targeted.</p>

                <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
                <p>While this app is safe for children in its gameplay, AdMob ads may not always be child-directed. If your child is using the app, we recommend enabling device parental controls and limiting ad tracking in your iOS settings.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vibration:</strong> To provide haptic feedback during gameplay (you can turn this off in settings).</li>

            <section>
